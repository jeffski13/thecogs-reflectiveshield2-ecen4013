# Project Description #
_“Fabulous.”_

_In the MAGE environment a good offense is a good defense. The reflective shield has the ability to
absorb magical attacks for a short period and release the energy back at the opponent. The shield also
holds the ability to change magical attacks into healing energy to aid allies in battle. The second
incarnation of the reflective shield is well known for its bizarre display of lights when it is being used, a
departure from the somber appearance of its older, and weaker, sibling. The user of this shield is sure to
be the center of attention anywhere, battlefields or otherwise._
